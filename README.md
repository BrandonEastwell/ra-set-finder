# RA Set Finder

`RA Set Finder` is a chrome extension that enhances [Resident Advisor](https://ra.co/) event pages by scraping DJ lineups and surfacing related DJ sets from YouTube.

*I use it to discover artists I have never heard of before.*

## Why?

As a music enthusiast and developer, I wanted a tool to easily surface DJ sets from artists I discover on Resident Advisor. 
This project helped me explore real-world scraping, Chrome extension APIs, and API proxying while focusing on user experience.

## Features

- Extracts DJ names directly from RA event pages
- Fetches high-quality DJ set links via YouTube Data API
- Caches results locally using `chrome.storage`
- Built with responsiveness and fast load in mind

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Extension Platform**: Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
- **Data Fetching**: YouTube Data API (server-proxied)
- **State/Cache**: chrome.storage
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Jest (backend)
- **Backend Proxy**: Node.js + Express.js (to protect API keys)

## Known Issues

- **Youtube API Limitations**: Standard daily quota of 10,000 when each request costs 100.
